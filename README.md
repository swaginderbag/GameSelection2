# GameSelection2
main.py saves username and password (register() function creates values for highscore1, score1 etc.) in the users.csv file
and opens the game selection through the login function


my goal is to save the scores from the games in the csv file besides the username and password
Spieleauswahl.py is not part of the program anymore just ignore it!
